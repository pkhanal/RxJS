##Reactive Messaging API

The examples are primitive uses browser console as of now :)
The html files are used to load the javascript files. Too lazy to build sexy demo. May be in future...
The example outlines the couple of use cases and demonstrates how they are tackled using the tranditional library and the new messaging library (in conjunction with RxJS)

###Contents:

- **messaging-v2.js:** A new messaging library prototype that provides higher level abstraction on top of Kaazing JMS Client Library. The library is Promise/A+ spec compliant and supports Reactive Extensions.
- **legacy-example.js:** It provides an example using the traditional JMS Client Library.
- **example-v2.js:** Example using new messaing library prototype and RxJS library.
